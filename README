README for Shanti Shiva Node Module

	The Shiva Node module allows for the creation and management of SHIVA visualizations within a Drupal website.
	
	The central module creates a "shivanode" content-type for SHIVA visualizations.
	
	The directories of the shivanode module folder are:
	   - css: for css stylesheets
	   - images: for various images used in the site
	   - js: contains the javascript for the module and html messaging as well as jQuery plugins used by the module.
	   - plugins: this contains the php/js/css code for the TinyMCE editor plugin
	   
	Other files to note are:
	   - pingurl.php: this file is called as a URI by the javascript to test KML url that users enter for map shiva nodes
